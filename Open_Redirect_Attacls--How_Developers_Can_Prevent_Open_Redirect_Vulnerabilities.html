<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">How Developers Can Prevent Open Redirect Vulnerabilities</h1><br/>Securing against open redirect vulnerability is almost the same as securing against phishing attacks - by validating URLs and displaying it to the user.<br /><br />Let's assume a URL of <a href="https://mysite.com/redirect.php?url=logout.php">https://mysite.com/redirect.php?url=logout.php</a> What we need to do to protect this from open redirect is as follows:<br />1. Get the value of the “url” parameter.<br />2. Get the domain states in the “url” parameter. In this case, it is “mysite.com”.<br />3. Compare the mysite.com against the specified blacklisted and whitelisted domains.<br />4. If the domain is whitelisted, just redirect automatically. If the domain is blacklisted, display a “Link Blocked” modal. But if the link is just normal, just display a warning showing that the user will be redirected to a separate site.<br /><br />If an IP address is blocked instead of a domain. The first thing that we need to do is simplify the IP address, then proceed to steps 3-4. Take note that there are different alternative IP address notations so we need to be sure to simplify everything.</div></body></html>
