<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">How Attackers Weaponize Open Redirect Vulnerabilities</h1><br/>Open redirect has various impacts. <br /><br />Sometimes it can be escalated to cross-site scripting (XSS) by using the payload <a href="https://mysite.com/redirect.php?url=javascript:alert()">https://mysite.com/redirect.php?url=javascript:alert()</a> , which can be to steal cookies and then can possibly be chained to account takeover if the website's cookies is not using the HTTPOnly flag. <br /><br />Another impact of open redirect is CRLF (carriage return, line feed) injection. This attack utilizes a CR and LF (%0d and %0a), which in simple terms, is an “enter” key. CRLF vulnerabilities can be used to rewrite a page, which can be used to “deface” the website or to host phishing attacks as well. <br /><br />The last 2 uses of open redirect vulnerabilities are for SSRF (server side request forgery) bypasses and for CSP (content security policy).<br /><br />In this lesson, we will be focusing on its main impact, to redirect the users in a malicious page. Attackers can weaponize this by finding open redirect vulnerabilities in “trusted” domains. Let's take Facebook as an example. Facebook has its own URL redirection located in l.php (short for Link Shim)<br /><br /><a href="https://facebook.com/l.php?u=https://google.com">https://facebook.com/l.php?u=https://google.com</a><br /><a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https://google.com">https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https://google.com</a><br /><br />If an attacker sends this link (<a href="https://facebook.com/l.php?u=https://google.com">https://facebook.com/l.php?u=https://attacker.com</a>) to his victim, the victim might think that “there is nothing suspicious here, it is just a link from facebook”. But what the victim does not know, is that he will be redirected to the attacker's Facebook phishing page (attacker.com). The victim may still think that the site is the legitimate Facebook and he will input his email and password. Once the victim inputs his credentials, the attacker will have access to the victim's account.<br /><br />That's how attackers can use open redirect vulnerabilities in combination to their phishing attacks. Luckily, Facebook's link shim is safe against open redirect vulnerability so we have nothing to worry about in Facebook.<br /><br />Now, what can developers do to secure their websites against open redirect vulnerabilities? Let's try to recreate Facebook's link shim.</div></body></html>
