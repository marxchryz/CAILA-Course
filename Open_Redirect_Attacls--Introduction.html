<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Introduction</h1><br/>URL redirection to untrusted site, or open redirect, is a vulnerability in which a web application accepts a user controlled input. This input contains a link to an external site in which the user will be redirected. This vulnerability is typically used by attackers in conducting phishing attacks.<br /><br />Here's an example, let's assume that we have a site entitled mysite.com. There is a url in mysite.com that is /redirect.php?url=logout.php. The purpose of this is when a user clicks the <a href="https://mysite.com/redirect.php?url=logout.php,">https://mysite.com/redirect.php?url=logout.php</a>. the user will be logged out.<br /><br />The problem arises here if an attacker changes this link to <a href="https://mysite.com/redirect.php?url=https://attacker.com">https://mysite.com/redirect.php?url=https://attacker.com</a> . An unknowing victim will think that the site that he clicked is “mysite.com” but what he does not know is he will be redirected to attacker.com<br /><br /></div></body></html>
