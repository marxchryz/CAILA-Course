<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Introduction</h1><br/>Reverse tabnabbing is a vulnerability that can be used in phishing attacks. Reverse tabnabbing (or tabnapping) is a vulnerability in which an opened tab can rewrite the contents of another tab. This works by exploiting the <strong>opener</strong> or the <strong>parent</strong> reference in javascript.<br /><br />Reverse tabnabbing occurs if a user clicks a link (a link that opens in a _blank page). The newly opened page will have access to the old page because it is its “opener” or “parent”. This means that the new page has a JavaScript code of<br /><div class="codebox"><div class="codebox">window.opener.location.href&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#3ad900;font-weight:400">"https://attacker.com"</span></div></div><br />the old tab will be redirected to the attackers website, even if the old tab is in background. This attack uses the victim's trust in his current opened tabs to ensure the attacks success. The victim will think that “This is my previous tab, this is safe because I just opened it”, but what the victim does not know is that it is a phishing site.<br /><br />Reference:<br /><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing">https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing</a></div></body></html>
